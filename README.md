###Project Statement


###Project Description
Over the years, there has been a surge in popularity of massively multiplayer online games. One prominent feature of these games is the dungeon raiding mechanics they employ. Players form groups to fight hordes of enemies and powerful bosses as they travel through dungeons in order to obtain rare items. However, players will usually have to play for many hours before they can experience these adventures, as they require high-leveled and well-equipped characters to survive. With our game, players will be able to form a group and raid dungeons right from the beginning.
